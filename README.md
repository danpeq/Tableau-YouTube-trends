# Tableau-YouTube-trends
I analyze YouTube video trends to determine what content deserves marketing attention, each video has a specific category, region, and date. I analyze: What categories were trending last week? How were the regions distributed? Which categories were particularly popular in the United States? I create a Dashboard with charts and analysis in Tableau.
